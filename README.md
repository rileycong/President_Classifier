**An end-to-end data science project that I use to learn image processing an classification**

# The steps in this project:
* Scraping pictures of 5 US presidents: Biden, Trump, Obama, Clinton, and George Bush using Fatkun Batch Download Image
* Data preprocessing an model building using OpenCV
* Deploy the model in a flask server
* Finally build the UI for the server (first time using JavaScript yay)
